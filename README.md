# Tiger Crab Studios

Original site: [Tiger Crab Studios with Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/view/tigercrabstudios/home)

Redesigned proposal site: [Tiger Crab Studios using React.js & published with Github Pages](https://julielin0812.github.io/tiger-crab-studios/)

**2018/01/21 Update**
- Replicated the basic layout of the main or "homepage" for Tiger Crab Studios using the React.js boilerplate, `create-react-app`
- Enlarged the logo banner
- Added a default font (Ruslan font from Google Fonts) for all headers
- Opted to go with a single row of social media icons/links (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) and place it at the bottom of the page. I decided to use black colored icons instead of the normal colored ones because the bright colors did not seem to fit in with the theme and feel of the site and intellectual property.
- Knowing that eliminating the top row of social media icons at the top would mean that users would have to scroll down to the very bottom of the page, I opted to add a navigation bar at the top with a "Follow Us" link to take users directly to the social media links. There are nav links to each section of the page.
- Kept the checkerboard-like grid design for the projects but separated the Development blog from the projects and gave it its own section.
- Added hover effects for all links
  - Inverted colors for the links in the navigation ban
  - Fade effect for the development blog & project images
  - Underline effect for the blog and project titles
  - Zoom-in effect for the social media icons
- Mobile responsive, mostly
  - Kept mobile responsiveness in mind while re-creating the site.
  - The two things I'd like to alter in the very near future is creating a hamburger navigation menu for mobile screens (800px or less) and possibly shrinking the social media icons so that they will all fit in a single line.
